# Dog Image Classification Using Deep Learning and Tensorflow

 In this project, I imported a dataset of dog images, train a convolutional neural network to classify those images, and improve the model performance. The original data is from Stanford, and it contains images of many dog breeds. In this project, however, I use a reduced dataset containing only five breeds.

Data Preparation: I have imported the necessary libraries and loaded the dataset of dog images. I have also performed data preprocessing steps such as rescaling the pixel values and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model Architecture: I have defined a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using the Sequential API of Keras. The model consists of multiple convolutional layers, max pooling layers, dropout layers, and dense layers. I have compiled the model with an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric.

Model Training: I have trained the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs. During training, I have used data augmentation techniques such as random flipping, rotation, and zooming to generate more training data and reduce overfitting.

Model Evaluation: I have evaluated the trained model on the testing data and calculated the accuracy of the model. I have also created a confusion matrix to analyze the performance of the model for different dog breeds.

Model Improvement: I have experimented with different network architectures and hyperparameters to improve the accuracy of the model. I have also discussed potential next steps for further improving the model, such as adding more dog categories and performing hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: I have provided a summary of the model's performance and insights gained from the confusion matrix. I have also mentioned that the model can be saved for future use.

- Beagles: The model seems to perform well at identifying beagles, with most of them being correctly predicted.
- Siberian Huskies: The model also has good accuracy with Siberian Huskies.
- Labrador Retrievers: The model appears to have some difficulty differentiating between Labrador Retrievers and other breeds, as there are several misclassifications.
- Bernese Mountain Dogs and Doberman Pinschers: The model struggles with these breeds, often misclassifying them as other breeds.

- Overall: The confusion matrix suggests that the model has reasonable accuracy for some breeds but could be improved for others, especially Labrador Retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, and Doberman Pinschers. Further analysis and potentially more training data might be needed to address these issues

This Jupyter Notebook serves as a demonstration of my skills in building and training deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras. It showcases my ability to preprocess data, design neural network architectures, train models, evaluate performance, and suggest improvements.
